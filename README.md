Hey there, I'm Stevie. C# programmer, ironic anime pfp-user, and professional retard™®©.

I mainly make Terraria mods (because there's nothing better to do!), but dabble in some other stuff from time to time.
Currently working on porting multiple mods to 1.4.
Tea is on hold & tStandalone is discontinued, Master Mode Reloaded will be ported to tModLoader 1.4 by MutantWafflez (who was the main MMR dev).
